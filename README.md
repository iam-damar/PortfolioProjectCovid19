## About Covid-19 Data Analysis Project

This time I tried to analyze the covid-19 data, where I got the covid data from the website: 

- Dataset link https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths

In this project there are several processes that I do such as:

- Data exploration using Excel
- Cleaning data using Query on SQL Server
- And print some required table data into Excel
- Then visualize using Tableau to find existing insights.

Sql Server is a Dbms Tools that can collaborate well with excel data in xlsx format. And Tableau can visualize Excel data quite well.

## Insight That I found

Tableau Visualization is [here](https://public.tableau.com/views/TableauCovid-19ResultAnalysis/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

- The percentage of deaths due to covid-19 in the world reaches 1.24% or as many as 61,336,800 people until 2022 in February.
- The continent with the highest total mortality is in Europe with a total death toll of 10 million, and the lowest is on the African continent.
- Among 5 countries, namely China, Brazil, Indonesia, United Kingdom, and the united states, the highest Covid-19 growth rate is in the United Kingdom, with a percentage of 29.32%. these 5 countries.
- it is predicted that after February 2022 the growth of Covid-19 in Indonesia will slow down or may even decrease.
